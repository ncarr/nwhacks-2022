# nwhacks-2022 - Educatr
[nwHacks](https://www.nwhacks.io/) is Western Canada's largest hackathon.

Our project lets users create interactive lessons for others to learn, in any academic subject. Creators can write lessons using a text editor with full Markdown and Latex support. They can also create their own questions to quiz the learners! We used Next.js, React, Springboot and MongoDB.
